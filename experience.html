                        <p>Over the course of my life, I've had the opportunity to participate in a variety of different things and gain valuable experience. Before my mission, I was heavily involved in sports, eventually deciding to focus solely on tennis. Playing sports allowed me to be able to develop a strong work ethic and diligence.</p>
                        <p>On top of playing lots of sports, I also got involved in coaching. Being able to coach several teams and individuals was truly amazing. After graduating highschool and coaching for a few months, I decided to serve a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was called to serve in the Belgium/Netherlands mission. Being able to represent my Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, on my mission was unforgettable. Not a day goes by where I don't think about a lesson learned from my mission. I was able to gain valuable experience in learning how to work with a variety of different people, learning and appreciating a new culture, and was able to serve in several leadership capacities as well.</p>
                        <p>Since being home, I have been studying at BYU, working several jobs, and figuring out who I want to be. I've been involved in a startup called Kulani Home, where I handcraft guitar and ukulele wall mounts. I also have the chance to teach Dutch at the Missionary Training Center (MTC). I have also set a goal to play Division 1 tennis for a school in Utah and have been currently training a lot to reach that level. These experiences continue to mold me into the man I am today and the man I want to be in the future.</p>
